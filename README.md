# Arvexis

<p>
  
  <img width="15%" src="https://github.com/sepgh/Arvexis/blob/main/assets/logo.png" align="left" />
  A node-based authoring tool for building interactive video experiences and artistic games. Authors compose a directed graph of scenes, conditions, and state mutations in a visual editor; the engine compiles it into a self-contained, offline-capable playable package.

## What It Does

1. **Author** — Open the editor in a browser. Build a graph of nodes:
   - **Scene nodes** — video layers composited over each other, with audio tracks, decision buttons, and an optional end flag.
   - **State nodes** — SpEL expressions that mutate global variables (e.g. `#VISIT_COUNT = #VISIT_COUNT + 1`).
   - **Condition nodes** — ordered SpEL boolean conditions that route the player along different edges.
2. **Preview** — Compile individual scenes or transitions at preview resolution and watch the result in-browser without leaving the editor.
3. **Compile** — Run the full pipeline: FFmpeg compositing → HLS conversion → packaging. Downloads a `dist.zip` containing a self-contained runtime.
4. **Play** — Extract `dist.zip` and run `./start.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `start.bat` (Windows). Open `http://localhost:8090` in any browser — no internet connection required.

## Where to Go From Here

| Goal | Document |
|------|----------|
| Understand the design and data model | [`docs/system-design.md`](docs/system-design.md) |
| Check implementation progress | [`docs/tasks.md`](docs/tasks.md) |
| Set up and run the editor | [`editor/README.md`](editor/README.md) |
| Browse the full REST API reference | [`editor/README.md → API Reference`](editor/README.md#api-reference) |

## Quick Start

### Compiled Binary

Quickest way to run the editor and start a new project is to download available binaries in [releases](https://github.com/sepgh/Arvexis/releases). 

### Prerequisites for building and running from source

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Java JDK | 21+ | `java -version` |
| Maven | 3.9+ | `mvn -v` |
| Node.js | 18+ | `node -v` |
| FFmpeg | Any recent | `ffmpeg -version` — required for compilation and preview |

### Run the Editor

```bash
# Easy way on linux
./build.sh
```

Or make native binary

```
./build-native.sh
```

Or

```bash
# 1. Build the frontend
cd editor/frontend
npm install

# 2. Build and start the backend. It will host frontend too.
cd editor/backend
mvn package -DskipTests
java -jar target/editor-backend-{VERSION}.jar   # replace with valid version
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** in a browser.

### Play a Compiled Package

```bash
# Extract the dist.zip downloaded from the editor, then:
./start.sh          # Linux / macOS
start.bat           # Windows
```

Open **http://localhost:8090** in a browser.

## Tech Stack

- **Editor backend** — Java 21, Spring Boot, SQLite (Flyway migrations), Spring SpEL
- **Editor frontend** — React 18, React Flow, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Video processing** — FFmpeg (CLI, abstraction layer)
- **Compiled runtime** — Lightweight embedded Java HTTP server, hls.js (bundled, no CDN)
- **Streaming** — HLS (`.m3u8` + `.ts` segments), multi-resolution
